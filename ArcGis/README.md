# ArcGIS Refugee Needs Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates a spatial analysis of refugee needs in Chad using ArcGIS. The goal of the project was to visualize the distribution of refugee camps across the country and assess areas that require immediate attention based on population density and available resources.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze the spatial distribution of refugee camps.
- Identify areas with the highest population density.
- Visualize resource allocation for better humanitarian response.

---

## Tools Used:
- **ArcGIS Pro** for spatial analysis and map creation.
- **ArcGIS Online** for interactive map sharing.
- **Spatial Analyst Tools**: Buffer, Clip, Overlay, and Heat Maps.

---

## Project Process:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collected data on refugee camps from UNHCR, including location, capacity, and population data.
   - Acquired shapefiles for Chadâ€™s geographical boundaries and population density.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and formatted data for import into ArcGIS.
   - Used the **Geocoding Tool** to map the locations of the refugee camps.

3. **Spatial Analysis:**
   - Performed **Buffer Analysis** to determine areas of influence for each refugee camp.
   - Used **Overlay** techniques to identify high-density areas and overlay refugee camp locations.
   - Generated **Heat Maps** to visualize population concentration and resource needs.

4. **Map Creation:**
   - Created multiple thematic maps, showing the refugee camps, population density, and areas in need of humanitarian aid.
   - Added clear labels, legends, and a scale for better understanding.

5. **Results and Insights:**
   - The project identified regions with the highest concentration of refugees, allowing for better resource planning.
   - Maps were shared via **ArcGIS Online**, enabling stakeholders to interact with the data.
